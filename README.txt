As a sophomore, I have only taken CS 1101 and CS 2201, meaning I only know Java and C++. Although me
using java did not affect the complexity of the game code, it did largely affect how I had to
generate the tweets. I understand the project was to take 2-6 hours, but in all honesty, without
knowing how to use API’s with the java language at all, the project took me 12-13+ hours.
I really really enjoyed doing the research with API’s as I feel like it is a great tool, and
this project is one I will definitely remember. Even if things don’t work out, I am grateful
I had the opportunity to work on this project. However, I do think that maybe having some more
direction on the project as there are some who have never worked with API’s before might have
been a little helpful.

Aside from that, I would like to talk about my code to generate the tweets a little bit as it
is very complicated. I had to utilize Maaven, Java unirests, and more to simply get the tweets
to load. Working with the endpoint was not super tough, but at the beginning, I had no idea what
to do with it. It took hours and hours of research and asking professors about their knowledge
on API’s to finally figure out how to use it with Java.

Some drawbacks are that the tweets are loaded by the twitter account, so the top half is
whichever account is inputted first. With more time, I would code the program to load the tweets by
chronological date.
